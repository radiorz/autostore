# about

 `AutoStore` it is a delicate and elegant modern response status management library, which provides strong state management capabilities and support `Response`,`Calculation property`,`Asynchronous calculation`,`Form two -way binding`,`Signal component` provide you with one -stop state management.

 **Main features:** 
 
- **Response core**:based on `Proxy` realization, data change automatically trigger view update.
- **Local calculation attribute**: The unique local calculation characteristics can be declared at any location in the state tree `computed` attributes, calculate the results in place.
- **Rely on automatic tracking**: Automatic tracking `computed` the dependence of attributes will be re -calculated only when dependent changes.
- **Asynchronous calculation**: Powerful asynchronous computing control ability, support `Timeout, retry, cancel, countdown, schedule` wait for advanced functions.
- **Status change monitoring**: Can monitor `get/set/delete/insert/update` operation monitoring of the state objects and array.
- **Signal component**:support `signal` the signal mechanism can achieve fine -grained components update.
- **Debug and diagnosis**:support `chrome` of `Redux DevTools Extension` debugging tools to facilitate debug status changes.
- **Nested state**: Support arbitrarily nested state without worrying about the complexity of state management.
- **Form binding**: Powerful and concise two -way form binding, data collection is simple and fast.
- **Cyclic dependence**: It can help detect cycle dependencies to reduce failure.
- **TypeScript**: Fully support TypeScript, provide complete types of inference and prompt
- **Unit test**: Provide a complete unit test coverage to ensure the quality of the code.
